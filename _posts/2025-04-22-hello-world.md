#  Hello, World!

Welcome to my very first blog post‚Äîand my very first blog!

This space will serve as a journal for my various projects and life journey, with a focus on Linux, technology, software, and video games.

## üõ†Ô∏è Current Projects

Right now, I'm in the middle of building my own **NAS** for backups and other self-hosted services. I'll be documenting everything along the way‚Äîlike setting up:

- **WireGuard**
- **Pi-hole**
- **Game servers**
- and more...

Expect some rants.

At the monent I am using Arch on my desktop, and mix of Fedora and Ubuntu on my servers and VMs.

## üíª Contributing to Open Source

One of the projects I'm currently contributing to is [**MangoHud**](https://github.com/flightlessmango/MangoHud) a Vulkan performance overlay for Linux gaming that actually ships on the [Steam Deck](https://store.steampowered.com/steamdeck)&trade;.

Open source contributions have been a bit slow for me this year, but I plan to get back into the groove soon.

## üéÆ What I'm Playing

Lately, **Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2** has been eating up a lot of my free time‚Äîand I‚Äôm absolutely loving it! Will post more about it as I get farther into it.
