# Help â€” I'm Stuck in the Middle Ages! ðŸŽ®

## Kingdom Come: Deliverance II

---

Lately, Iâ€™ve taken a break from my usual server experiments to spend some time in medieval Bohemia.

**Kingdom Come: Deliverance II**, from **Warhorse Studios** (based in Czechia), has really grabbed my attention. Itâ€™s a story-driven action RPG set in the early 1400s, during the reign of King Wenceslaus IV â€” who, as it turns out, was deposed and imprisoned by his half-brother, **Sigismund**.

Itâ€™s been a fun journey â€” and a great excuse to nerd out on some history.

I played the first **Kingdom Come: Deliverance** many moons ago â€” I want to say back in 2018? I believe I was rocking an AMD Radeon Vega 56 at the time. It completely captivated me. Iâ€™m a sucker for RPGs and historical settings, so picking up the sequel was a no-brainer.

The game features a realistic medieval backdrop: bustling towns, bandits, beggars, knights, noblemen, kings â€” and of course, plenty of horse manure.

Iâ€™ve gone all-in with immersion. I even set up a keybind to turn the HUD off completely. If you're curious, you can do this by opening the in-game console (`~`) and entering:
- `bind f2 wh_ui_showHUD 0` to hide the HUD  
- `bind f3 wh_ui_showHUD 1` to bring it back

It has history, action, romance â€” and itâ€™s downright gorgeous. The combat system is unlike anything Iâ€™ve played (besides the first game). It's incredibly rewarding once you get the hang of it.

One gripe I have is the save system: you need a special drink called *Savior Schnapps* to save manually. That said, the game autosaves after completing certain quests and when you exit the game â€” so itâ€™s not too punishing.

Overall, Iâ€™d highly recommend this game to any fan of RPGs, history, or story-driven experiences.

And yes â€” Iâ€™m playing this on **Linux**. My setup:

- **OS:** Arch Linux  
- **CPU:** AMD Ryzen 9 7950X3D  
- **GPU:** AMD Radeon RX 7900 XTX  
- **Display:** Alienware AW3225QF 32" 4K OLED HDR

It runs buttery smooth. Iâ€™m honestly impressed. The only other recent game Iâ€™ve played that uses a similar engine is *Star Citizen*, which runs on a heavily modified CryEngine fork called *Star Engine*.

I'm using the open-source AMD graphics stack: the `amdgpu` kernel driver and `mesa` for userspace. Occasionally I run into glitches or performance issues. In *Kingdom Come: Deliverance II*, I found a bug where being indoors with sunlight shining in causes the screen to fill with small white rectangles.

So, in true Linux user fashion, I filed a [bug report](https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/mesa/mesa/-/issues/12932) on Mesa's GitLab. It got some traction and will hopefully be fixed in an upcoming release.

Thatâ€™s all for now â€” just wanted to share some quick thoughts. Iâ€™ve put about 50 hours into the game so far, and it still feels like I have a long way to go!
