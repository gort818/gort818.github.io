## Part 1 of the server series  
___  

![Jonsbo N2 Case](https://www.jonsbo.com/Upfiles/Prod_X/2022111754166.webp)

I originally planned to use three 8TB HDDs from Seagateâ€”specifically, the IronWolf NAS drives.  
Unfortunately, they were out of stock for weeks. So, I ended up going with some Toshiba N300 NAS drives instead.  
I plugged them into the hotswap bay of my Jonsbo N2.

### Setup:
- RAID 1  
- LVM  
- Samba share  

Now it was time to mount.  
I confidently ran:

```
sudo mount /mnt/samba/share
```

and...

### OMG  
The most horrific noise erupted from my little server box.  
Imagine two cats fightingâ€”with the background ambiance of two boiling pots of water continuously spilling onto the floor.  
The sound echoed throughout my entire living room.

I wiped the drives and packed them back into their boxesâ€”never to be seen again.  

Lesson learned. I ended up ordering three 4TB Seagate IronWolf NAS drives instead.  
Honestly, I think I overestimated my storage needs in the beginning.
