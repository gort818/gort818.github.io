<p>Welcome to my very first blog post—and my very first blog!</p>

<p>This space will serve as a journal for my various projects and life journey, with a focus on Linux, technology, software, and video games.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="️-current-projects">🛠️ Current Projects</h2>

<p>Right now, I’m in the middle of building my own <strong>NAS</strong> for backups and other self-hosted services. I’ll be documenting everything along the way—like setting up:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>WireGuard</strong></li>
  <li><strong>Pi-hole</strong></li>
  <li><strong>Game servers</strong></li>
  <li>and more…</li>
</ul>

<p>Expect some rants.</p>

<p>At the monent I am using Arch on my desktop, and mix of Fedora and Ubuntu on my servers and VMs.</p>

<h2 id="-contributing-to-open-source">💻 Contributing to Open Source</h2>

<p>One of the projects I’m currently contributing to is <a href="https://github.com/flightlessmango/MangoHud"><strong>MangoHud</strong></a> a Vulkan performance overlay for Linux gaming that actually ships on the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/steamdeck">Steam Deck</a>™.</p>

<p>Open source contributions have been a bit slow for me this year, but I plan to get back into the groove soon.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="-what-im-playing">🎮 What I’m Playing</h2>

<p>Lately, <strong>Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2</strong> has been eating up a lot of my free time—and I’m absolutely loving it! Will post more about it as I get farther into it.</p>

<hr />

<p>Thanks for stopping by, come back soon there will be more to come!</p>]]></content><author><name>Alessandro Toia</name></author><category term="intro" /><category term="linux" /><category term="nas" /><category term="self-hosting" /><category term="open-source" /><category term="gaming" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello, World!
