    "content"  : "\n  📦 Server Series — Part 1\nNext up: RAID + LVM setup, Samba sharing, and more…\n\n\nPart 1 of the server series\n\n\n\n\nI originally planned to use three 8TB HDDs from Seagate—specifically, the IronWolf NAS drives.\nUnfortunately, they were out of stock for weeks. So, I ended up going with some Toshiba N300 NAS drives instead.\nI plugged them into the hotswap bay of my Jonsbo N2.\n\n\n\nSetup:\n\n  RAID 1\n  LVM\n  Samba share\n\n\nNow it was time to mount.\nI confidently ran:\n\nsudo mount /mnt/samba/share\n\n\nand…\n\nOMG\nThe most horrific noise erupted from my little server box.\nImagine two cats fighting—with the background ambiance of two boiling pots of water continuously spilling onto the floor.\nThe sound echoed throughout my entire living room.\n\nI wiped the drives and packed them back into their boxes—never to be seen again.\n\nLesson learned. I ended up ordering three 4TB Seagate IronWolf NAS drives instead.\nHonestly, I think I overestimated my storage needs in the beginning.\n\nCheck back soon for more!\n\n\n\n🧭 Server Series Index:\n\n  ✅ Part 1: HDD Trouble (you are here)\n  🔜 Part 2: RAID + LVM Setup\n  🔜 Part 3: Samba + Backup Strategy\n\n"

I’ll be documenting everything along the way—like setting up:\n\n\n  WireGuard\n  Pi-hole\n  Game servers\n  and more…\n\n\nExpect some rants.\n\nAt the monent I am using Arch on my desktop, and mix of Fedora and Ubuntu on my servers and VMs.\n\n\n\n💻 Contributing to Open Source\n\nOne of the projects I’m currently contributing to is MangoHud a Vulkan performance overlay for Linux gaming that actually ships on the Steam Deck™.\n\nOpen source contributions have been a bit slow for me this year, but I plan to get back into the groove soon.\n\n\n\n🎮 What I’m Playing\n\nLately, Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2 has been eating up a lot of my free time—and I’m absolutely loving it! Will post more about it as I get farther into it.\n\n\n\nThanks for stopping by, come back soon there will be more to come!\n\n"
