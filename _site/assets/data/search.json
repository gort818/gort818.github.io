    "content"  : "Hello, World!\n\nWelcome to my very first blog post—and my very first blog!\n\nThis space will serve as a journal for my various projects and life journey, with a focus on Linux, technology, software, and video games.\n\n\n\n🛠️ Current Projects\n\nRight now, I’m in the middle of building my own NAS for backups and other self-hosted services. I’ll be documenting everything along the way—like setting up:\n\n\n  WireGuard\n  Pi-hole\n  Game servers\n  and more…\n\n\nExpect some rants.\n\nAt the monent I am using Arch on my desktop, and mix of Fedora and Ubuntu on my servers and VMs.\n\n\n\n💻 Contributing to Open Source\n\nOne of the projects I’m currently contributing to is MangoHud a Vulkan performance overlay for Linux gaming that actually ships on the Steam Deck™.\n\nOpen source contributions have been a bit slow for me this year, but I plan to get back into the groove soon.\n\n\n\n🎮 What I’m Playing\n\nLately, Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2 has been eating up a lot of my free time—and I’m absolutely loving it! Will post more about it as I get farther into it.\n\n\n\nThanks for stopping by, come back soon there will be more to come!\n\n"
